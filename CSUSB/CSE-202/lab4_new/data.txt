Create a program that makes you guess the letters of a word or phrase. It will be a game is similar to hangman. Name your program file hangman and your source file hangman.cpp

The program should start by displaying underscores for each letter in the word or phrase. Then the user guesses 1 letter. If the letter is in your word/phrase then the program replaces all underscores with that letter, the partially solved word/phrase is refreshed and displayed again, and the user can guess another letter.

If the user guesses a letter that doesn't exist in your word/phrase 6 times, then the program ends with the message "You Lose!"

When the user guesses all the correct letters, then the program ends with the message "You win!"

Hint: You can implement this program using character vectors.
